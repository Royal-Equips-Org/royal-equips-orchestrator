Building the Royal Equips Empire automation platform is a multi‑stage program that builds on the existing “royal‑equips-orchestrator” repository and leverages the infrastructure and integration scaffolding provided. The goal is to create an AI‑driven e‑commerce system that can operate across multiple channels (Shopify, Amazon, bol.com, Printful) and scale from €0 to €100K+ monthly revenue with minimal human intervention.

Phase 1 – Foundation (Weeks 1–4)

Objectives:

Bootstrap the repository with a clear structure for API, agents, connectors, and deployment scripts. The repository’s layout and existing CI/CD workflow (GitHub Actions, Docker build/push, deployment jobs) must be mirrored and extended
git-scm.com
.

Set up the core infrastructure: PostgreSQL, Redis, RabbitMQ, and a FastAPI server with appropriate environment variables.

Implement the initial platform engine, channel manager, agent orchestrator, and authentication middleware.

Deploy a basic product research agent that discovers trending products using supplier APIs and creates products in Shopify via GraphQL.

Clean up the Shopify store app ecosystem (remove redundant apps) and configure EU‑only markets, VAT settings, and a luxury theme.

Deliverables:

Repository & CI/CD: A GitHub repository with the structure shown in the infrastructure blueprint, including GitHub Actions workflows for testing, building, and deploying Docker images
git-scm.com
. Secrets for server deployment, database, and API keys should be configured in GitHub.

Core platform code: Implement platform/core/platform_engine.py, platform/core/channel_manager.py, platform/core/agent_orchestrator.py, and the FastAPI entry point (platform/api/main.py).

Base agent and first agent: Implement platform/agents/base_agent.py and platform/agents/product_research_agent.py, including integration with AutoDS/Spocket and Shopify APIs for product creation.

Database schema and migrations: Use Alembic to generate the tables for channels, products, orders, agents, etc., as defined in the schema specification.

Phase 2 – Core Agent Suite (Weeks 5–12)

Objectives:

Extend the agent system to include the Inventory & Pricing Agent and the Marketing Automation Agent. These agents monitor inventory across all suppliers, perform dynamic pricing based on margin/competition/demand rules, and run email/SMS campaigns via services like Klaviyo or Twilio.

Integrate BigQuery (or equivalent) for historical sales analysis and build basic demand forecasting models using scikit‑learn or simple moving averages.

Add the order fulfilment agent to classify risk, forward orders to suppliers and update tracking information via Shopify/Printful APIs.

Enhance monitoring and alerting: implement Prometheus and Grafana dashboards, health checks, and automated backups using the provided scripts and workflows.

Deliverables:

Additional agents: Implement inventory_pricing_agent.py and marketing_automation_agent.py, including features such as auto‑reordering, competitor price monitoring, demand forecasting, customer segmentation, triggered campaigns, and A/B testing.

API endpoints and dashboard: Add FastAPI endpoints for agents (list/start/stop/execute), products, orders, and analytics, using WebSocket for real‑time updates. Build a React dashboard to visualize agent status, sales metrics, and inventory.

Monitoring: Deploy Prometheus and Grafana with the provided prometheus.yml and Grafana provisioning files. Configure health checks, log shipping, and Slack alerts.

Phase 3 – Scaling & Optimization (Weeks 13–24)

Objectives:

Expand the agent ecosystem to include advanced business functions: Customer Service, Supplier Management, Content Creation, Competitor Analysis, Fraud Detection, Predictive Analytics, Financial Management, Quality Control, SEO Optimization, and Social Media management.

Introduce new revenue streams such as Print‑on‑Demand (via Printful) and wholesale operations; add Amazon and bol.com connectors to the Channel Manager.

Implement more sophisticated ML models (e.g., demand forecasting, price elasticity, churn prediction) and integrate BigQuery or another analytics warehouse for centralized data.

Scale the infrastructure: optionally split services onto multiple servers, add a load balancer, and prepare for Kubernetes or serverless deployment at higher revenue levels.

Deliverables:

Agent ecosystem: Complete the Tier 2 and Tier 3 agents with clear configuration schemas, dependencies, and error‑handling strategies.

Analytics engine: Implement additional analytics endpoints and dashboards; create ML pipelines for demand, churn, and pricing models.

Infrastructure upgrades: Add support for multi‑server deployments (e.g., separate database server), implement autoscaling rules, and refine security (role‑based access control, rate limiting, intrusion detection).

Phase 4 – Empire Expansion (Months 6–12)

Objectives:

Launch multiple brands and open additional sales channels; enable white‑label licensing of the automation system.

Introduce B2B and subscription models, offering SaaS access to the platform.

Implement advanced AI strategies: self‑improving agents, predictive analytics across markets, and 3D/AR product visualization.

Deliverables:

Multi‑brand capability: Enhance the platform to support multiple Shopify or custom stores, each with separate agent configurations.

SaaS readiness: Build user and billing management features, incorporate OAuth/JWT authentication for external users, and package the system for use by third‑party merchants.

Advanced features: Add modules for blockchain‑based authenticity verification, AR/VR product viewers, IoT‑enabled inventory management, and edge computing for faster regional processing.

Cross‑Cutting Concerns

Throughout all phases, emphasize code quality (PEP 8, type hints, comprehensive testing), security (JWT/OAuth, environment variable management, HTTPS, encrypted backups), and monitoring (logs, metrics, alerts). Each agent must implement a health_check method and register with the orchestrator; the orchestrator should monitor health, restart failing agents, and expose metrics via Prometheus. Use the provided deployment scripts and systemd/cron configuration to automate backups, health checks, and maintenance tasks.
Empire Automation Roadmap

This document outlines the multi‑phase plan for constructing and scaling the Royal Equips Autonomous Empire Command Center. It serves as a living blueprint for all development activities. Keep it updated as new modules are built and deployed.

Market Intelligence & Web Scraping: Continuously refine data collection from public and private sources (suppliers, competitors, market trends). Use proper scraping strategies and respect API rate limits and terms of service.

Orchestrator‑core: bevat een robuuste AgentBase en een asynchrone Orchestrator die agents registreert, plant, uitvoert en health checks uitvoert.

Orchestrator‑api: de module empire_api.py realiseert een FastAPI‑backend met echte businesslogica, database‑modellen (ProductOpportunity, Agent, Campaign), Redis‑caching, Celery‑tasks, en endpoints zoals / (status), /empire/status, /empire/metrics die data uit de orchestrator en financial controller ophalen.

Deze code vormt al een goede basis voor agent‑coördinatie en API‑exposure. De volgende stappen zijn:

Dieper onderzoek: de overige directories verkennen (services, integrations, agents, app, infra e.d.) om alle logica en eventuele placeholders te identificeren.

Inventariseren van ontbrekende onderdelen: checken of er mocks of dummy‑implementaties zijn die moeten worden vervangen door echte API‑calls (bijvoorbeeld in de agents voor product research, market intelligence, supplier intelligence).

Plan concretiseren: op basis van deze inventarisatie het plan/todo‑overzicht in het roadmap‑document aanvullen met specifieke taken en benodigde modules.

Start development: de kernmodules uitbreiden met ontbrekende functies (Shopify‑integratie, marktanalyse, supplier API’s), extra agents implementeren en de frontend beginnen.


This roadmap is a living document. Update it after each sprint or major development to reflect progress, obstacles, and new opportunities.
