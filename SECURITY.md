export LOG_SECURITY_EVENTS=true

# Enable self-healing
export ENABLE_AUTO_HEALING=true
export SECURITY_MONITORING=true
```

### Regular Security Maintenance
```bash
# Automated security checks
python scripts/security_audit.py --comprehensive
python scripts/empire_autonomous_analyzer.py --analysis-type=security

# Dependency updates
pip-audit --fix
safety check -r requirements.txt

# Static analysis
bandit -r app/ orchestrator/ scripts/
```
