# Royal Equips Empire Blueprint

## Mission and Vision
The mission of the Royal Equips Empire is to build a fully autonomous, AI‑driven e‑commerce platform capable of scaling from €0 to €100K+ monthly revenue with minimal human intervention. This platform will replace traditional SaaS solutions by orchestrating a fleet of AI agents that manage product research, supplier management, inventory, pricing, marketing, order fulfilment, analytics and customer service.

## System Architecture Overview
The platform is organised into several core components:
- **Channel Management Engine** – Provides a unified interface to external sales channels (Shopify, Amazon, bol.com, Printful, etc.) to handle product synchronisation, order aggregation and inventory management.
- **Agent Orchestrator** – Manages and schedules the execution of dozens of AI agents. Each agent inherits from `AgentBase`, implements `run()` and `health_check()`, and communicates via a JSON protocol.
- **Data & Analytics Layer** – Stores operational data in PostgreSQL (Supabase) and analytics in BigQuery, with Redis for caching and message queues for inter‑agent communication.
- **Frontend & APIs** – FastAPI/Flask services provide admin dashboards and REST/WebSocket interfaces, while the frontend (React/Next.js) is served via CDN with Cloudflare.

## Infrastructure & CI/CD
The repository includes comprehensive GitHub Actions workflows for testing, building and deploying both backend and frontend services. Dockerfiles and docker‑compose configurations define development and production environments, including databases (PostgreSQL), cache (Redis), message queue (RabbitMQ), Prometheus/Grafana monitoring, Nginx reverse proxy and deployment scripts. Automated backups, security scans and health checks are also provided.

## Database Schema Highlights
The platform defines robust schema for channel configuration, product information, variants, categories, inventory locations, orders, fulfilment and more. Tables are designed with UUID primary keys, JSONB fields for flexible configuration, timestamps for auditing and foreign key constraints to maintain integrity.

## Initial Agent Suite
Phase 1 introduces core agents:
- **ProductResearchAgent** – Integrates with AutoDS and Spocket to find trending products, compute margins and create products in Shopify.
- **InventoryPricingAgent** – Monitors inventory levels and adjusts pricing based on demand signals and historical sales.
- **MarketingAutomationAgent** – Triggers email and SMS campaigns via Omnisend/Klaviyo and generates customer segments.
- **OrderFulfillmentAgent** – Automates order risk evaluation, routes fulfilment to AutoDS/Printful and synchronises tracking data.
- **AnalyticsAgent** – Aggregates sales and traffic metrics, writes to BigQuery and generates dashboards.

Later phases propose additional agents for customer service, loyalty programmes, supplier management, content creation, competitor analysis, fraud detection and advanced predictive analytics.

## Standards & Practices
All agents must implement `health_check()` for unified monitoring, and the orchestrator exposes a `/api/health` endpoint for system health. Code quality standards include PEP 8 compliance, type hints and 80%+ unit test coverage. Security best practices require OAuth for third‑party integrations, HTTPS everywhere, encryption of secrets and regular vulnerability scans.
