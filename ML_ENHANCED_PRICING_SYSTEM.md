## Core ML Services

### 1. ML Rule Optimizer (`ml_rule_optimizer.py`)

**Purpose**: Uses historical performance data to predict optimal rule parameters and continuously improve pricing rules.

**Key Features**:
- Trains Random Forest and Gradient Boosting models on historical performance data
- Predicts optimal confidence thresholds, price change limits, and profit margins
- Provides rule performance insights and recommendations
- Automatically retrains models as new data becomes available

**Usage**:
```python
from orchestrator.services.ml_rule_optimizer import MLRuleOptimizer, RulePerformance

# Initialize optimizer
optimizer = MLRuleOptimizer()

# Record performance data
performance = RulePerformance(
    rule_id="high_confidence_auto",
    timestamp=datetime.now(),
    confidence_threshold=0.85,
    price_change_percentage=0.08,
    revenue_impact=1500.0,
    profit_margin_change=0.03,
    conversion_rate_change=0.02,
    customer_satisfaction_score=85.0,
    market_response_time=180.0,
    success_score=88.5
)
optimizer.record_performance(performance)

# Get optimized parameters
market_context = {
    'expected_price_change': 0.08,
    'market_volatility': 0.4,
    'competitive_intensity': 0.6
}
optimal_params = optimizer.predict_optimal_parameters("rule_id", market_context)
```

### 2. Market Sentiment Service (`market_sentiment_service.py`)

**Purpose**: Analyzes real-time market sentiment from news, social media, and market indicators to enhance pricing decisions.

**Key Features**:
- Multi-source sentiment analysis (news APIs, social media, market indicators)
- Real-time trend analysis and volatility calculation
- Predictive confidence forecasting based on sentiment trends
- Sentiment-based alert system with configurable thresholds

**Usage**:
```python
from orchestrator.services.market_sentiment_service import RealTimeMarketSentiment

# Initialize sentiment analyzer
sentiment_analyzer = RealTimeMarketSentiment()

# Analyze market sentiment
sentiment_data = await sentiment_analyzer.analyze_market_sentiment(
    "e-commerce", 
    ["online shopping", "retail pricing", "consumer behavior"]
)

# Get sentiment alerts
alerts = sentiment_analyzer.get_sentiment_alerts({
    'negative_sentiment': -0.2,
    'high_volatility': 0.6
})
```

### 3. Predictive Forecaster (`predictive_forecaster.py`)

**Purpose**: Uses time series analysis to predict confidence scores and market conditions, enabling proactive decision making.

- Market condition forecasting (sentiment, volatility, price pressure)
- Predictive alert system to prevent issues before they occur
- Model accuracy tracking and performance metrics

**Usage**:
```python
from orchestrator.services.predictive_forecaster import PredictiveForecaster

# Initialize forecaster
forecaster = PredictiveForecaster()

# Record observations for training
forecaster.record_observation(
    confidence_score=78.5,
    sentiment_score=0.25,
    volatility=0.35
)

# Generate forecasts
forecasts = forecaster.forecast_confidence(
    current_confidence=78.5,
    current_sentiment=0.25,
    current_volatility=0.35,
    forecast_horizons=[1, 6, 24]
)

# Get predictive alerts
alerts = forecaster.get_predictive_alerts()
```

### 4. Cross-Agent Tools (`cross_agent_tools.py`)

**Purpose**: Provides shared ML-powered tools that can be used across different agents for enhanced intelligence.

**Available Tools**:

- **Market Opportunity Scanner**: AI-powered identification of revenue opportunities  
- **Competitive Intelligence**: Real-time competitor analysis and threat assessment
- **Demand Forecasting**: Advanced demand prediction with seasonal analysis
- **Price Elasticity Analyzer**: Dynamic price sensitivity analysis by customer segment
- **Inventory Optimization**: AI-driven inventory level optimization

**Usage**:
```python
from orchestrator.services.cross_agent_tools import CrossAgentTools

# Initialize tools
tools = CrossAgentTools()

# Execute customer lifetime value analysis
clv_result = await tools.execute_tool(
    "customer_lifetime_value",
    "pricing_optimizer",
    {"customer_data": customer_data, "time_horizon": 24}
)

# Scan for market opportunities
opportunities = await tools.execute_tool(
    "market_opportunity_scanner",
    "pricing_optimizer",
