# Production Errors - Fix Summary

**Date**: October 15, 2025  
**Branch**: `copilot/fix-realtime-agent-monitor`  
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE - Ready for Deployment

---

## Executive Summary

Three critical production errors were identified from server logs and have been successfully fixed:

1. **Agent Monitor NoneType Error** - Crashed metrics collection every ~30 seconds
2. **GitHub Rate Limit Warning Spam** - Flooded logs with duplicate warnings
3. **Edge Functions Event Loop Error** - Background monitoring thread crash

All fixes have been tested and validated. The changes are minimal, surgical, and backward-compatible.

## Issues Fixed

### ✅ Issue 1: Agent Monitor NoneType Callable Error

**Severity**: HIGH - Recurring error every 30 seconds

**Error Pattern**:
```
ERROR:app.services.realtime_agent_monitor:Failed to collect agent metrics: 'NoneType' object is not callable
```

**Root Cause**:  
Line 80 in `app/services/realtime_agent_monitor.py` used `hasattr(agent_executor, 'get_agent_executions')` which returns `True` even if the attribute exists but is `None`. When the code tried to call the method, it failed with `'NoneType' object is not callable`.

**Fix Applied**:
```python
# BEFORE (Line 80):
if agent_executor is None or not hasattr(agent_executor, 'get_agent_executions'):

# AFTER (Line 80):
if agent_executor is None or not callable(getattr(agent_executor, 'get_agent_executions', None)):
```

**Impact**: The agent monitor will now gracefully skip metrics collection when the executor is not fully initialized, eliminating the error.

### ✅ Issue 2: GitHub Service Rate Limit Warning Spam

**Severity**: MEDIUM - Log flooding reducing visibility of real errors

**Error Pattern**:
```
WARNING:app.services.github_service:GitHub rate limit exceeded - will retry after cooldown
ERROR:app.services.github_service:Error calculating repository health: RetryError[...]
ERROR:app.sockets:GitHub updates emission failed: RetryError[...]
```

**Root Cause**:  
Line 100 in `app/services/github_service.py` logged a rate limit warning but never updated `self._last_rate_limit_warning`, causing the 5-minute throttle check to always pass and log the warning on every single request.

**Fix Applied**:
```python
# BEFORE (Line 100):
if self._last_rate_limit_warning is None or \
   (now - self._last_rate_limit_warning).total_seconds() > 300:
    logger.warning("GitHub rate limit exceeded - will retry after cooldown")
    # Missing: self._last_rate_limit_warning = now

# AFTER (Lines 100-101):
if self._last_rate_limit_warning is None or \
   (now - self._last_rate_limit_warning).total_seconds() > 300:
    logger.warning("GitHub rate limit exceeded - will retry after cooldown")
    self._last_rate_limit_warning = now  # <-- Added
```

**Impact**: Rate limit warnings will now only appear once every 5 minutes instead of on every request, reducing log spam by ~99%.

---

### ✅ Issue 3: Edge Functions Async Event Loop Error

**Severity**: HIGH - Background monitoring thread crash

**Error Pattern**:
```
ERROR:app.routes.edge_functions:Monitoring task error: asyncio.run() cannot be called from a running event loop
```

**Root Cause**:  
Line 471 in `app/routes/edge_functions.py` called `asyncio.run()` from a background thread. If Flask already had an event loop running, this would raise `RuntimeError: asyncio.run() cannot be called from a running event loop`.

Additionally, line 111 attempted to call `asyncio.create_task()` from a synchronous Flask route, which also fails outside an async context.

**Fix Applied**:

**Fix 1 - Background Thread (Lines 467-471)**:
```python
# BEFORE:
def monitoring_task():
    while True:
        try:
            asyncio.run(check_all_edge_functions_health())  # ❌ Fails in running loop

# AFTER:
def monitoring_task():
    # Create a new event loop for this thread
    loop = asyncio.new_event_loop()
    asyncio.set_event_loop(loop)
    
    while True:
        try:
            loop.run_until_complete(check_all_edge_functions_health())  # ✅ Works
```

**Fix 2 - Sync Route (Line 111)**:
```python
# BEFORE:
@edge_functions_bp.route('/status')
def get_edge_functions_status():
    asyncio.create_task(check_all_edge_functions_health())  # ❌ Fails in sync route

# AFTER:
@edge_functions_bp.route('/status')
def get_edge_functions_status():
    # Background monitoring thread handles async checks periodically
    # Removed problematic asyncio.create_task call
```

**Impact**: Background monitoring thread will run reliably without crashing. Edge function health checks will work correctly.

## What Was NOT Fixed (Requires Manual Action)

### ❌ GitHub API Token/Rate Limit Issues

**Why not fixed**: These are external/configuration issues, not code bugs.

**What you need to do**:

1. **Verify GitHub Token is Set**:
   ```bash
   # Check production environment has this variable
   echo $GITHUB_TOKEN
   ```

2. **Check Token Hasn't Expired**:
   - Go to https://github.com/settings/tokens
   - Verify token is still valid
   - Regenerate if expired

3. **Ensure Correct Scopes**:
   - Token needs `repo` scope for repository access
   - Public repo requires at least `public_repo` scope

4. **Rate Limit Considerations**:
   - Unauthenticated: 60 requests/hour
   - Authenticated: 5,000 requests/hour
   - If still hitting limits, consider GitHub Enterprise for higher quotas

**Current State**: The code now handles rate limits more gracefully with better logging and circuit breakers, but cannot fix missing/invalid tokens.

---

### ❌ Database Connectivity Issues

**Why not fixed**: Configuration issue, not a code bug.

**What you need to do**:

If you see errors about agent executor not initializing:

1. **Verify DATABASE_URL is Set**:
   ```bash
   # Check production environment
   echo $DATABASE_URL
   ```

2. **Test Connection String**:
   - Ensure format is correct: `postgresql://user:pass@host:port/dbname`
   - Test connectivity from production server
   - Verify credentials haven't expired

3. **Fallback Behavior**:
   - Code falls back to SQLite if DATABASE_URL is not set
   - This works for development but not recommended for production

---

### ❌ Unit Test Failures (tests/unit/test_github_service.py)

**Why not fixed**: Tests expect features that don't exist yet.

**Issue**: The test file expects enhanced caching methods that were planned but never implemented:
- `_rate_limit_remaining` attribute
- `_rate_limit_reset_time` attribute
- `_cache` and `_cache_ttl` attributes
- `_check_rate_limit()` method
- `_get_cached()` and `_set_cache()` methods

**Recommendation**: Either:
1. Implement the full caching feature as a separate enhancement
2. Update/remove the test file to match current implementation
3. Mark tests as `@pytest.mark.skip` until feature is implemented

**This is NOT a production error** - it's a test/feature gap that doesn't affect running services.

## Deployment Checklist

Before deploying to production:

- [x] Code changes reviewed and validated
- [x] All syntax checks pass
- [x] Import tests pass
- [x] Functionality tests pass
- [ ] Merge to `develop` branch
- [ ] Deploy to staging environment
- [ ] Monitor logs for 30 minutes (should see errors disappear)
- [ ] Deploy to production
- [ ] Verify `GITHUB_TOKEN` is set in production
- [ ] Verify `DATABASE_URL` is set in production
- [ ] Monitor production logs for 1 hour

---

## Expected Production Impact

### Immediate Effects (within minutes)

✅ **"NoneType object is not callable" errors** → Should disappear completely  
✅ **"asyncio.run() cannot be called" errors** → Should disappear completely  
✅ **GitHub rate limit warning spam** → Reduced by ~99% (once per 5 min instead of continuous)

### Ongoing Effects

⚠️ **GitHub RetryErrors** → Will still occur if token is missing/invalid/rate-limited (requires manual token fix)  
ℹ️ **Agent metrics** → Will collect successfully once agent executor initializes with valid DATABASE_URL  
ℹ️ **Edge function monitoring** → Will run reliably in background without crashes

---

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur after deployment:

1. **Revert the PR**:
   ```bash
   git revert <commit-hash>
   git push origin develop
   ```

2. **Or deploy previous commit**:
   ```bash
   git checkout <previous-commit>
   # Deploy...
   ```

3. **Verify rollback**:
   - Check logs return to previous error pattern
   - Confirm services are stable

The changes are minimal and isolated, so rollback should be safe and straightforward.

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (Required)
1. ✅ Code changes complete and tested
2. Merge this PR to `develop`
3. Deploy to staging
4. Test in staging for 30 minutes
5. Deploy to production
6. Verify GITHUB_TOKEN and DATABASE_URL are set

### Follow-up Actions (Recommended)
1. Implement enhanced GitHub caching (separate PR)
2. Add rate limit metrics to monitoring dashboard
3. Update unit tests to match current implementation
4. Consider GitHub Enterprise if rate limits remain an issue
5. Add alerting for circuit breaker activation

---

## Questions?

If you see any errors after deployment that are NOT covered in the "What Was NOT Fixed" section, please:

1. Capture the full error traceback
2. Note the timestamp and frequency
3. Check if `GITHUB_TOKEN` and `DATABASE_URL` are set
4. Open a new issue with details

This fix addresses the three most common errors in your logs. Any remaining issues are likely configuration-related or new problems.
