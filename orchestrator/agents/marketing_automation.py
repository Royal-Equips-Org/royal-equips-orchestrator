"""Agent for automated marketing campaigns and customer engagement.

The ``MarketingAutomationAgent`` orchestrates marketing activities such
as email campaigns, push notifications, and social media posts. It
integrates with Shopify's marketing APIs to create and send campaigns
based on insights from other agents (e.g. trending products, forecast
surplus). This agent demonstrates how high-level orchestration can
drive top-line growth without manual intervention.
