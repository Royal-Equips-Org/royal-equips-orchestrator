# Deployment Fix Summary - Command Center UI Conflict Resolution

## Issue Identified
The Render deployment was serving an **old version** of the Command Center UI due to duplicate static file directories causing conflicts between frontend and backend.

## Root Causes
1. **Duplicate Static Directories**: 
   - `/app/static/` (old build with `/command-center/assets/...` paths)
   - `/static/` (project root, expected by Flask)
   - Both directories had different versions of `index.html` and assets

2. **Build Output Misconfiguration**:
   - Vite was building to `apps/command-center-ui/dist/` by default
   - Flask was configured to serve from project root `/static/`
   - Old builds in `/app/static/` were being committed to git

3. **Mock Data in TypeScript Services**:
   - `apps/aira/src/routes/system.ts` had hardcoded mock metrics
   - `apps/aira/src/routes/health.ts` had placeholder health check implementation

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Frontend Build Configuration
**File**: `apps/command-center-ui/vite.config.ts`
- Changed build output directory from `dist/` to `../../static/`
- Added `emptyOutDir: false` to preserve `static/styles.css`
- Now builds directly to the location Flask expects

**File**: `apps/command-center-ui/package.json`
- Updated `copy-functions` script to copy to `../../static/`
- Ensures Cloudflare Functions are copied to correct location

### 2. Cleanup of Duplicate Files
- **Removed**: `/app/static/` directory entirely (old build with 23 files)
- **Added to .gitignore**: `apps/command-center-ui/dist/` to prevent future commits
- **Kept**: Project root `/static/` as single source of truth

### 3. Flask Route Updates
**File**: `app/routes/main.py`
- Changed root route `/` to redirect to `/command-center`
- Ensures users land on the React SPA instead of fallback template
- Maintains backward compatibility with command center routes

### 4. Mock Data Removal
**File**: `apps/aira/src/routes/system.ts`
- Removed all hardcoded mock agent counts and metrics
- Replaced with real Node.js process metrics (CPU, memory, uptime)
- Added clear messages directing to Flask orchestrator for real data
- Returns integration endpoints for proper API connections

**File**: `apps/aira/src/routes/health.ts`
- Implemented real Shopify API health check
- Checks for required environment variables (`SHOPIFY_STORE`, `SHOPIFY_ACCESS_TOKEN`)
- Makes actual API call to Shopify admin endpoint
- Returns accurate health status instead of placeholder `true`

## Build Process

### Development
```bash
cd apps/command-center-ui
npm install
npm run dev  # Vite dev server on port 3000
```

### Production Build
```bash
cd apps/command-center-ui
npm run build  # Outputs to /static/
```

The build now:
1. Compiles React + TypeScript to optimized bundles
2. Outputs directly to `/static/` directory
3. Copies Cloudflare Functions to `/static/functions/`
4. Generates proper asset paths (`/assets/...` instead of `/command-center/assets/...`)

## Flask Serving

Flask configuration in `app/__init__.py`:
```python
static_dir = Path(__file__).parent.parent / "static"
app = Flask(__name__, static_folder=str(static_dir))
```

Routes:
- `/` â†’ Redirects to `/command-center`
- `/command-center` â†’ Serves React SPA with fallback routing
- `/command-center/*` â†’ SPA client-side routing

## Verification Checklist

- [x] Removed duplicate `/app/static/` directory
- [x] Updated Vite build output to `/static/`
- [x] Added `apps/command-center-ui/dist/` to `.gitignore`
- [x] Removed mock data from `system.ts`
- [x] Implemented real Shopify health check in `health.ts`
- [x] Updated Flask root route to serve React app
- [x] Verified build outputs to correct location
- [ ] Test Flask serves correct index.html in production
- [ ] Verify no mock data in API responses
- [ ] Confirm Render deployment uses new build

## Production Deployment

On Render:
1. **Build Command**: `pip install -r requirements.txt && cd apps/command-center-ui && npm install && npm run build`
2. **Start Command**: `gunicorn --worker-class eventlet -w 1 --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT wsgi:app`
3. **Expected Behavior**: 
   - Root URL (`/`) redirects to `/command-center`
   - React app loads with new build assets from `/static/`
   - No old UI with `/command-center/assets/...` paths
   - API endpoints return real data (not mocks) when credentials are configured

## Files Changed

### Configuration
- `apps/command-center-ui/vite.config.ts` - Build output directory
- `apps/command-center-ui/package.json` - Copy functions script
- `.gitignore` - Exclude dist folder

### Backend
- `app/routes/main.py` - Root redirect to command center
- `app/static/` - Entire directory removed (23 files)

### TypeScript Services  
- `apps/aira/src/routes/system.ts` - Mock data removed, real metrics added
- `apps/aira/src/routes/health.ts` - Real Shopify health check implemented

### Build Artifacts
- `/static/index.html` - New build
- `/static/assets/*` - New asset bundles (59 new files)
- `/static/functions/*` - Cloudflare Functions

## No Mock Data Policy

Per project requirements, **all mock/simulated data has been removed**:

1. âœ… **TypeScript Services**: 
   - System status returns real process metrics
   - Health checks use actual API connections
   - Errors returned when credentials missing (not mock fallbacks)

2. âœ… **Python Backend**:
   - Previously verified in `COMPLETE_MOCK_REMOVAL_FINAL.md`
   - All endpoints require real credentials
   - No fallback mock data in production paths

3. âœ… **Frontend**:
   - Connects to real Flask API endpoints
   - Shows loading states or errors when data unavailable
   - No hardcoded sample data in components

## Next Steps

1. **Verify on Render**:
   - Check deployment logs for successful build
   - Visit deployed URL and verify new UI loads
   - Inspect HTML source to confirm asset paths

2. **API Integration**:
   - Configure environment variables for real API keys
   - Test Shopify, GitHub, OpenAI integrations
   - Verify data flows from Flask â†’ AIRA â†’ Frontend

3. **Documentation**:
   - Update README with new build process
   - Document environment variables required
   - Add troubleshooting guide for common issues

## Technical Details

### Why Root Static Directory?
Flask's `static_folder` is configured at app initialization. Using project root `/static/` simplifies:
- Single source of truth for static assets
- No confusion between multiple static directories
- Direct serving without path rewrites
- Compatible with Render's file structure

### Why Remove app/static/?
The `/app/static/` directory was:
- An artifact from old build process
- Contained outdated builds (October 7, 2025)
- Had different asset paths causing routing conflicts
- Not the directory Flask was configured to serve from

### Build Output Structure
```
/static/
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html              # Entry point
â”œâ”€â”€ assets/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index-*.js         # Main bundle
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index-*.css        # Styles
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ *Module-*.js       # Lazy-loaded modules
â”œâ”€â”€ functions/             # Cloudflare Functions
â””â”€â”€ config.json            # Configuration files
```

## Success Criteria

âœ… **Build succeeds** and outputs to `/static/`  
âœ… **No old builds** remain in repository  
âœ… **Flask serves** React app from correct location  
âœ… **Mock data removed** from all TypeScript services  
âœ… **Routes configured** to direct users to SPA  
ðŸ”„ **Deployment tested** on Render (pending)  
ðŸ”„ **Real data flows** through APIs (pending credentials)
