# Health Endpoints Fix - Complete Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-05  
**Issue:** Health endpoints returning HTML instead of JSON  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED AND VERIFIED

---

## Problem Statement

All three health probes (`/health`, `/healthz`, `/readyz`) were returning Vite frontend HTML shell instead of valid diagnostic JSON data. This broke:

- Kubernetes liveness/readiness probes
- Load balancer health checks
- Monitoring tools (Prometheus, Datadog, New Relic)
- Uptime monitoring services (UptimeRobot, Pingdom)
- Docker health checks

**Symptoms:**
```bash
$ curl http://localhost:10000/health
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    ...
```

**Expected:**
```bash
$ curl http://localhost:10000/health
{"status":"ok","service":"Royal Equips API","timestamp":"2025-10-05T15:00:00.000Z"}
```

## Root Cause Analysis

### Technical Details

1. **Route Registration Order Issue**
   - Health routes were only registered under `/v1` prefix
   - Root-level routes (`/health`, `/healthz`, `/readyz`) were not registered
   - Requests to root-level health endpoints resulted in 404 Not Found

2. **SPA Fallback Handler**
   - The `setNotFoundHandler` in Fastify server caught all 404s
   - If request had `Accept: text/html` header, it returned `index.html`
   - Browsers and many tools send `Accept: text/html` by default
   - Health endpoints fell through: Request → 404 → SPA Handler → HTML Response

3. **Proxy Misconfiguration**
   - Cloudflare Workers proxy didn't explicitly handle health endpoints
   - Vite dev server didn't proxy health endpoints to backend
   - No Accept header normalization for health requests

### Flow Diagram

**Before Fix:**
```
Client Request: GET /health
  ↓
[Fastify Server]
  ↓ (route not found at root level)
[404 Not Found]
  ↓
[setNotFoundHandler]
  ↓ (request has Accept: text/html)
[Returns index.html] ❌
```

**After Fix:**
```
Client Request: GET /health
  ↓
[Cloudflare Proxy] (sets Accept: application/json)
  ↓
[Fastify Server]
  ↓
[Health Route Handler at ROOT level] ✓
  ↓
[Returns JSON {"status":"ok"}] ✅
```

## Solution Implementation

### 1. Server Routing Fix

**File:** `apps/api/src/server.ts`

**Changes:**
```typescript
// BEFORE: Health routes only under /v1
app.register(api, { prefix: "/v1" }); // health routes here
await app.register(fastifyStatic, { root: webRoot });
app.setNotFoundHandler(async (req, reply) => {
  if (req.method === "GET" && accept.includes("text/html")) {
    return reply.sendFile("index.html"); // Catches /health!
  }
});

// AFTER: Health routes at root level FIRST
const healthRoutes = await import("./v1/health.js");
await app.register(healthRoutes.default); // ROOT LEVEL
app.register(api, { prefix: "/v1" });
await app.register(fastifyStatic, { root: webRoot });
app.setNotFoundHandler(async (req, reply) => {
  const isApiRoute = path === '/health' || path === '/healthz' || ...;
  if (req.method === "GET" && accept.includes("text/html") && !isApiRoute) {
    return reply.sendFile("index.html");
  }
});
```

**Key Points:**
- Health routes registered BEFORE static file serving
- Health routes registered BEFORE SPA fallback
- SPA fallback explicitly excludes health endpoints

### 2. Health Endpoints Enhancement

**File:** `apps/api/src/v1/health.ts`

**Added Endpoints:**
- `/liveness` - Alias for `/healthz` (compatibility)
- `/readiness` - Simplified readiness check (compatibility)

**All Endpoints:**
- `/health` - Comprehensive health diagnostics
- `/healthz` - Kubernetes liveness probe
- `/readyz` - Kubernetes readiness probe with dependency checks
- `/liveness` - Alternative liveness endpoint
- `/readiness` - Alternative readiness endpoint

### 3. Cloudflare Workers Proxy

**File:** `workers/api-proxy.ts`

**Changes:**
- Added dedicated proxy handlers for each health endpoint
- Each handler forwards to `UPSTREAM_API_BASE` with proper headers
- Sets `Accept: application/json` to force JSON response
- Renamed worker's own health check to `/worker/health`
- Added error handling for upstream failures

### 4. Simple Cloudflare Proxy

**File:** `cloudflare-proxy/worker.js`

**Changes:**
- Detects health endpoint requests
- Sets `Accept: application/json` header for health requests
- Ensures proper header forwarding

### 5. Vite Development Server

**File:** `apps/command-center-ui/vite.config.ts`

**Changes:**
- Added proxy configuration for all health endpoints
- Forwards health requests to backend on port 10000
- Ensures development environment matches production behavior

## Testing and Validation

### Integration Test Script

**File:** `apps/api/test-health-endpoints.sh`

**Tests:**
1. All 5 health endpoints return JSON (not HTML)
2. HTTP status codes are correct (200 for ok, 503 for not ready)
3. Content-Type is `application/json`
4. Response body is valid JSON
5. Required fields present in response
6. Accept: text/html header still returns JSON
7. Backward compatibility: `/v1/health` works

**Test Results:**
```bash
$ ./test-health-endpoints.sh

🧪 Testing Health Endpoints
============================

Testing GET /health...
  ✅ PASS: HTTP 200, Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8

Testing GET /readyz...
  ✅ PASS: HTTP 503, Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
  Status: error

Testing GET /liveness...

  Status: ok

Testing GET /readiness...
  ✅ PASS: HTTP 200, Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
  Status: ok

Testing with Accept: text/html header...
  ✅ PASS: Returned JSON even with Accept: text/html
